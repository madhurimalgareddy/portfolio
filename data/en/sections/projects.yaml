    Every week, the same problem arose at the local grocery store either the shelves were emptied too quickly, leaving customers disappointed, or excess stock remained unsold, leading to waste. The question was clearâ€”how could customer demand be predicted more accurately?.<br>
    <br>
    Output: Various forecasting techniques were used to forecast demand of Wilkin's products and achieved a MAPE of 8% with the help of exponential smoothing.
